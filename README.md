# International-Trade-Replication-2

Although I already added both the files for the first and second replication assignments to the original International Trade repository, this made for a disorganized experience. As such, I have now created two repositories, one for each assignment, and will reupload the original files to the appropriate repository. 

Simply download all files in this repository into a single file, open the file replication_2_final_version_2.do, change the file path as necessary, and run the code to produce the required table.

For tables and judgment called in Latex form, see Replication_2_tables_and_judgment_calls.pdf.
